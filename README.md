## Description:
----------------

In order to understand the global distribution of precipitation as widely as possible, station- and radar measurements 
are not sufficient. Considering the meteorological observation network clearly shows that a direct observation on water
surfaces is virtually absent on the basis of conventional station equipment. In polar and desert regions this is also true.
Satellites could solve this problem. For this purpose, the GPM-satellite is equipped with a microwave camera
(GMI GPM Microwave Imager) and a dual-frequency radar (DPR Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar). 
Following the long collaboration participation of the University of Bonn at several NASA GPM ground-validation field-campaigns,
the polarimetric research radar BoXPol has became one of the few European research radars part of an international network
for ground validation of the GPM satellite. Routinely BoXPol performs specific scans for GPM overpasses, and its polarimetric
capabilities are exploited in order to estimate high quality rain rate fields within the GPM overpass field-of-view. 
Therefore the BoxPol retrievals are used to evaluate the corresponding products from the different suit of algorithms
currently used by GPM. For each overpass of GPM on the region detected by the Bonner radar, two and three dimensional data is created. This provides information about the current precipitation. To compare the GPM and BoXPol data, the polar data of the Bonn radar have to be interpolated on the GPM grid.
